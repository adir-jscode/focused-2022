           <p>Stay open-minded; stay focused. Train hard and train smart. For me, the older I get, the smarter I have to train also,
        because the recovery time is longer. Work on everything: become a well-rounded fighter - don't just be good at one
        thing; be good at everything.</p>

                <p>My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor,
                and some style.</p>

                <p>You can't buy vision, and you can't buy aesthetic.Your vision will become clear only when you can look into your own heart. Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside,
                awakes.</p>

                <p>Having goals that we are passionate about gives us something to look forward to each and every morning when we wake up.
                Not having goals is an excellent recipe for average living.</p>

           <p>The United States is helping lead the global fight against COVID-19. On July 2, in partnership with COVAX, we shared 2.5
        million doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine with Bangladesh. Together we will build a world that is safer and more
        secure against this and future pandemics.
        The U.S. is bringing urgency to international vaccination efforts. In partnership with COVAX, we shared an additional 3
        million doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine with Bangladesh on July 19. We are committed to vaccinating as many people
        as possible, as quickly as possible.
        The U.S. stands with the people of Bangladesh in the fight against COVID-19. We have donated another 1,003,860 Pfizer
        vaccine doses to Bangladesh on September 1. We are grateful for all those hard at work to save lives.
        On October 5, the United States delivered another 5 million doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine to Bangladesh. We are
        committed to working with our partners in Bangladesh to save lives and bring an end to this pandemic.
        The U.S. is proud to partner with Bangladesh in our efforts to end the COVID-19 pandemic. We delivered 3.5 million
        Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine doses to Bangladesh in November. More vaccines delivered means more lives saved.
